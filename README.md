# BlackoutGame
A game that requires you to survive.

_**1. KNOWN BUGS**_
There are a LOT of bugs in this shell of a game, but it is playable. From the archive it was normally executed there weren't any big problems, but what do I know?

_**2. CONTROLS & MECHANICS**_
Inside the game there is a bare bones manual (Again, it's from the previous execution site) but it doesn't have much info, so details are below.

_**2-1. ACTIONS**_
There are 3 to 4 actions that you can choose, which are the following;
- Explore (Better Scavenge)
- Scavenge
- Sleep (Triggers Events)
- Fix

_**2-2. IDs**_
There are 2 IDs (At V.0.1 I think?) which are the following;
- 1 = Water Renewal System or WaterRen
- 2 = Oxygen Generator or OxyGen

_**2-3. EVENTS**_
Events are just that, they are still unstable so nothing drastic will happen.

_**2-4. PLANETS**_
There are around 6 planets to explore and scavenge, 3 are bad and 3 are good.

**That's about it for V.0.1, This will be updated until V.1 when proper changelogs are done.**
